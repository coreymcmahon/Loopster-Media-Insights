This is a tool for tracking the fangrowth of Facebook Pages across time.

It uses PHP and the Symfony framework. jQuery is used for some of the UI effects. The app is also integrated with MailChimp so that new registrations can be 'opted-in' to existing MailChimp databases.

  (note: test version on shared hosting, performance may be less than ideal)

The application uses the Facebook API and an access token (provided by the user) to pull the 'Like' count of the different pages set up in the database. Because an access token is used to make the call, the application can retrieve the 'Like' count of Pages with age restrictions (ie: alcohol brands).

The update needs to be triggered daily. This can either be done using the 'backend' interface (requires admin access) or can be automatically initiated from the command line via a CRON job.

Happy playing!
